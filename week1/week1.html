<h3>about me</h3>
<p>I'm taking this class to work towards the web developer certificate. I recently graduated from UBC with a BSc majoring in Animal Biology and minoring in Psychology. I have a wonderful two year old son named Harrison. I have a German Shepherd name Ember, who I train in a protection sport called French Ring Sport. I love audible books, ted lectures and playing soccer.<p>
