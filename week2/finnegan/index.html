<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that I don't talk, I have quite a lot to say. Herein lies the thoughts of a Duck Toller, living the high life in Burnaby, BC, Canada. My name is Finnegan von Tollerstein, pleased to meet you.</p>

<h2>Daycare Rocks</h2>

<p>Occasionally I get to go to daycare, or <b>party!</b> as <a href="#">Alistair</a> calls it. It's quite a lot of fun, with all the other dogs, the agility stuff and the handlers who run us around all day.</p>
<p>I can usually figure out when it is a daycare day because I don't get fed in the morning.  It's always confusing to me at first, so I usually poke Alistair a few times to remind him, but once the tupperware container comes off it's shelf, I know what's going on.</p>
<p>The best days at daycare are easily the days when Montana is there.  She's a Duck Toller like me and we're inseparable.  Our owners even feed us the same food.</p>
<p>Sadly, each daycare day must come to an end, but I've usually had such a great time, I flake out in the car and sleep for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I wonder when I'm going next....</p>

<h2>Swimming the Creek</h2>

<p>A few times a week, Alistair and I go to Bridgman Park in North Vancouver for a walk on the off-leash dog trail and a swim in the creek.  I absolutely LOVE the water so it's always a welcome retreat.</p>
<p>Starting last spring, a tree fell over the creek that Alistair will stand on while I swim against the current.  It's tons of fun and I get a lot of exercise just swimming against the current.  Other dogs splash in to see what I'm doing and generally get confused as to what I'm actually doing, then they leave.  I keep swimming.</p>
<p>I wonder when I'm going next....</p>
